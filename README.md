# FinShark financial web-app

A financial stock portfolio web-app, adapted from youtuber Teddy Smith's tutorial.
[Teddy Smith's github project ](https://github.com/teddysmithdev/FinShark)

Originaly followed to better understand the multiple aspects of web-apps, not just React. Multiple changes were made to the original tutorial. Tutorial still ongoing, only the frontend part is somewhat completed.

## Changes

Project made with React Vite instead of classic React installation. Bootstrap and React-bootstrap components were used instead of Tailwind for CSS, reason being I wanted to learn about multiple parts of a react project without having to learn tailwind a recopy Teddy Smith's original tutorial. I made multiple changes to the visual aspects of the app to better suit my vision.

The project will soon be made available on my portfolio page. Daily max api request : 250.

## Installation

Get your free API key from [FMP](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/).
